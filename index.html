        "He just doesn’t seem to be the same person.  He forgets things, has problems following a conversation, and he loses his temper more easily.  He can not tolerate noise or too many things going on at once.  His sleeping and eating habits have changed.  It takes him much longer to figure out something or finish doing something than it used to.  I have to remind him to do almost everything.

        Brain injury can occur during an automobile accident, work related accident, military combat, electrocution, or any kind of trauma to the head such as a concussion.  When brain injuries occur because of an outside force, it is often referred to as Traumatic Brain Injury.  Brain injuries also result from illnesses such as strokes, aneurysms, seizures, cancer or tumor, hydrocephalus, brain surgery, encephalopathies (infections or metabolic imbalances that affect the brain), and lack of oxygen to the brain during surgery. Also, drugs and alcohol abuse, medication overdoses or severe adverse side effects, and toxic exposure to chemicals can cause brain injury.  These types of events are usually referred to as Acquired Brain Injuries.
      </p>

      <p>
        Brain injuries affect people in various ways, depending on the location and severity of the injury.  A patient may or may not have been in a coma or lost consciousness, but there is a significant change in a person’s thinking skills and personality after suffering a brain injury.  Changes in thinking and daily functioning are often noted by the patient’s family and friends, even if the patient does not recognize any problems with their thinking.  Common symptoms of brain injury include decreases in memory, attention, concentration, speech or language skills, reading, math, naming of objects, word finding, making decisions, solving problems, motivation, initiation, tolerance for frustration, and anger control.  Also, psychiatric symptoms often are a result of brain injury with the most common being depression and anxiety.  Sometimes headaches and seizures accompany brain injuries.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is critical to have brain injuries evaluated through neuropsychological testing as soon as possible.  The brain usually does the most healing in the first two years after injury and that is the time period to begin using cognitive rehabilitation to help learn new ways of doing things.  Testing identifies those areas of thinking that need treatment. The brain usually does not heal 100% and the person will likely have some problems the remainder of their lives.  However, we cannot determine to what extent the brain will heal itself or what problems will remain. Those things vary widely from person to person.  We do know that cognitive rehabilitation, which is a therapy aimed at teaching someone how to compensate for their limitations, has the most powerful impact when provided during the first two years after the brain injury.  Neuropsychological testing is often recommended sometime within the first 6 months after injury (if possible), and then is repeated at the 1 year and 2 year marks to document the patient’s progress and remaining areas of difficulty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Testing also helps determine if a person has the cognitive or thinking skills needed to return to work or school.  If it is determined that a person can work, but cannot return to their previous job, recommendations can be made for the type of environment in which a person would work best.  Recommendations are also made for the person who wishes to return to school or college.  This testing is required in schools and colleges to get learning assistance.

      <h4>What is neuropsychological testing?</h4>
      <p>
        Neuropsychology is the study of the relationship between the brain and behavior.  Testing involves understanding how a healthy or an unhealthy brain is functioning.  CT scans and MRIs usually can identify if there is something that has structurally changed in the brain, such as a significant injury, stroke, tumor, etc.  However, these tests usually run by a neurologist cannot tell a person how well their brain is working.  Neuropsychological evaluations are pencil and paper tasks that challenge a person’s abilities in all the areas of thinking, including attention, planning, organization, problem solving, memory, drawing abilities, spatial relationships, academic skills, language, senses, ability to think quickly, and other cognitive skills.  Neuropsychological testing is more thorough than psychological or even psychoeducational testing in that it goes beyond assessing personality, intelligence and emotional functioning and assesses all areas of the brain.
      </p>

      <h4>Is neuropsychological testing right for you?</h4>

      <p>
        "I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a personality disorder, attention deficit, post-traumatic stress disorder, OCD, depression and anxiety.  I want to know what is really the problem?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Neuropsychological testing is for anyone who believes they have a change or problem in their thinking and want to know what the cause is and how to treat it.  Often a person has a head injury or has suffered an illness and are referred by their neurologist for testing.  However, some people are referred by their general physician, psychiatrist, rehabilitation specialists, lawyer, Workers’ Compensation case manager, or school psychologist.  Not all patients have had an injury or illness; in the case of learning disabilities, the person may have always had the problem. If you have a concern about your daily functioning, ability to work, succeed in school, or have any problems in your thinking or emotions, then neuropsychological testing may be the service you need to answer your questions and provide recommendations toward improving your functioning.
      </p>

      <h4>What does neuropsychological testing involve?</h4>

      <p>
        Testing can take 1-2 days depending on the problem.  The first hour is an interview with the patient and any family members that may be able to provide additional information about the patient’s history.  You will be asked questions about your injury, illness or learning problem, as well as questions about your mood, daily activities, medical history, medications, education, work, and social history. The remainder of the day will be spent testing the various functions of the brain through different kinds of tasks to see how well you perform. Once testing is completed, the tests are scored, interpreted, and a detailed report is written that can be shared with any of your physicians and /or with your school.

        "He has problems paying attention in school and at home.  He doesn't finish his homework unless I am over him the whole time, and then he often forgets to turn it in.  The teacher says he seems to be daydreaming a lot and he talks too much in class.

        Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a widely used term now in schools and homes to describe people who have problems paying attention. However, ADHD is a condition that includes more than just paying attention.  The area of the brain affected is where the highest level of thinking takes place, and therefore, everything from planning, organizing, judgment and decision making are all problematic for the person who has ADHD.
      </p>

      <p>
        Common complaints parents make about their children who may have ADHD are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Not listening and complaining of forgetfulness</li>
        <li>Problems starting and finishing tasks</li>
        <li>Taking a long time to complete a task</li>
        <li>Needing outside structure such as frequent prompting to stay on task</li>
        <li>Organizing materials and forgetting books and homework</li>
        <li>Lack of motivation to do chores or uninteresting things</li>
        <li>Not being able to follow multi-step directions</li>
        <li>Over-talkativeness and excessive energy</li>
        <li>Impulsivity</li>
        <li>Irritability and argumentativeness</li>
        <li>Problems with messiness in their rooms and with their personal belongings</li>

        Parents may wonder if their teens are "lazy," rebellious, disrespectful, or if they have a problem processing information.  In general, most kids really want to do their best, and what may appear as laziness or apathy may be the teen's reaction to being frustrated in their overall performance. Individuals with these issues often suffer from low self-esteem because it seems that the harder they try, the less they get accomplished.  Depression and anxiety often accompany ADHD and other learning problems as the person does not feel able to overcome their learning obstacles.
      </p>

      <p>
        ADHD and learning disabilities cannot be diagnosed with a simple behavior checklist or a one hour interview with a psychologist or psychiatrist.  ADHD in particular can mimic other disorders, such as depression and anxiety or behavioral disorders.  Thorough testing has to be conducted to determine if the person really has ADHD, to what degree, and what areas of functioning are affected.  In addition, other learning disabilities, such as reading, math, or auditory processing problems, co-occur in 70% of the individuals who have ADHD.  It is important to determine where the thinking process is inefficient so that the right course of treatment can be recommended.  Stimulant medications help only individuals who truly have ADHD, and they generally increase ability to focus and therefore learn; however, they do not "fix" the other issues of executive functions such as planning and decision making.  Strategies often need to be learned to help the person work around their weak areas, which vary from individual to individual.  Testing is crucial in identifying a person's strengths, as well as their weaknesses, so that they may build on their strengths to succeed in school and in life.  If the problem is not ADHD, but anxiety or depression, different medications and treatment options would be recommended to address the issue.  In the case of other learning disorders, stimulant medications would not be useful, but tutoring and cognitive rehabilitation in the person's areas of weakness can make a huge impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you or your teen has a learning problem, the information you would learn through testing and cognitive rehabilitation would be invaluable to you in terms of ensuring success.  Even if your child has been tested in elementary school, their brains have developed since then and what may have been a problem before most likely has changed.  Re-testing in middle school and high school is important to document the changes in development and identify new areas of strength and weakness.  For teens and college students, such testing is required in order to gain assistance from the college’s Learning Centers.  The Board of Regents has on their web site the documentation required for a college student to have additional time for tests, tutoring, and other accommodations needed to optimize learning.  Testing must be current to obtain Learning Center services.

        As we age, our thinking skills change and we realize that we are not as mentally sharp as we once were.  The question is when to worry about these changes and begin to think about the possibility of Dementia. There are a number of different kinds of Dementia, or what people used to call "senility".  Dementia is a disease of the central nervous system that basically reduces brain functioning gradually over time. Dementias include Parkinson's, Creutzfeld-Jacob, Lewy Body, Vascular Dementia (which is caused by strokes) and other progressive diseases of the brain. The most familiar type of dementia is Alzheimer's dementia.  The main characteristic of Alzheimer's is gradual loss of short term memory, but other things can also be affected.  The person can have problems making decisions, paying bills, finding their way around, recalling names, finding the right word to say, controlling or showing emotions, or remembering how to do things.  Often the early signs of dementia look like depression and a person may be sent for neuropsychological testing to determine which diagnosis is the most accurate.  It is important to diagnose Alzheimer’s early because there are helpful treatments that can slow the progression of the disease, though there is no cure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another term that is being used more frequently is Mild Cognitive Impairment, or MCI.  Individuals with MCI have a decrease in one or more areas of thinking, but the decrease is not significant enough to be diagnosed as a dementia.  This is a crucial time to diagnose problems with thinking and memory because it is currently believed that the earlier a person receives treatment, the better chance that the medications will slow the decline in thinking.  If you have a concern that your thinking skills are not as good as they once were, and you are worried that the changes are not just a part of normal aging, then you may want to ask us about neuropsychological testing.
